Data can autosave changes to data with the use of the "persist" keyword.  

A page which contains a data object with a persist keyword automatically inserts
javascript into every page change action.  The javascript then forces a call to
AJAX if the user clicks a link, submit button and warns the user when the user
presses the back or forward navigation button.

This AJAX call then automatically stores the data.  If the "memory" keyword is
also used, this AJAX call stores the data in the "memory" cache, otherwise it
stores the data in the "user" cache.

Recalling a single value for populating forms:

If the user wants to recall a single item from a complex data object,
the user can use [[data source="object" item="name"]]

If the user wants to store a single item from a complex data object,
the user can use [[data source="object" recall="name" dom="id"]], which
connects an element to the data store when the save action occurs.

If the user wants to automate this process, the user can use the input
and/or validation object that automatically generates form-type elements such that:

[[valid phone source="object" populate item="telephone" id="dom_id" ...]]

[[input text source="object" populate item="name" id="dom_id" ...]]

If the user has not instantiated a data object with [[data get="..."]] or [[data load="..."]]
and makes calls to valid, input, etc, the data object will be loaded automatically.

Note: it may be a good idea to implement a new global $_GC, containing all page tags and
associated parameters must now be stored in a global per-page array, 
called $_GC['tag']=array( param=>value );

This must be generated by the GC interpreter.

We must eventually demonstrate all cases for use of this object.

ex:  Search/Result -> ReadOnly / Edit button and check for user rights etc.
