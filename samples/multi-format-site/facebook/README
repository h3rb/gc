Use the Facebook IFRAME-style app API to create a versionfor Facebook, written using .html files (not .php) and deployed using GC.Edit the file "facebook.keys" and put your API keyson lines 1 and 2 of the file.  Line 1: appapikeyLine 2: appsecretEach file in a folder of your site that has a copy ofthis file will have the API pre-ended and included automatically.You can then use any part of the Facebook PHP API, and you can use the $user_id variable to access Facebook user information, in conjunction with GC,in any of your .htm or .html files.See Facebook Developers (developers.facebook.com) for more informationon how to integrate with Facebook using FBML and the Facebook API.(c) 2010 Ganos LLC
